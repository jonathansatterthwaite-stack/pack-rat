# Pack Rat

> **Pack Rat is now [Is This A Mimic?](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/is-this-a-mimic)**, a fresh start under a new name. This repository is archived: get the app, the guide and new versions there.

**An inventory manager for tabletop RPGs.** Every character's gear, coins and containers, on PC, phone or in the browser: on your own, or shared at the table over your own Wi-Fi, with no account and no internet needed.

## What it does

- **Containers that make sense.** Backpacks inside chests, gear strapped to the outside, quivers that only take arrows, waterskins that know how full they are, and a gauge on every container as it fills. ([Containers](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/pack-rat/wiki/Containers))
- **Play together at the table.** Host a party from the Windows or Android app; everyone else joins by scanning a QR code. Each player keeps their own inventory, and trades, shops and the GM's changes reach everyone live. ([Party play](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/pack-rat/wiki/Party-Play))
- **Tools for the GM.** Shops that buy and sell, treasure hoards and roll tables, control panels of sliders, switches and maps, and item states with rules (a blade that curses whoever attunes to it). ([Running the game](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/pack-rat/wiki/Running-the-Game))
- **Live, hand-drawn icons.** Draw an item's icon from shapes and make it move: a waterskin's level, a clock showing the real time, a compass turning towards a ship on the GM's sea chart. ([Drawn icons](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/pack-rat/wiki/Drawn-Icons))
- **D&D 5e built in, any game you like.** The SRD 5.1 catalog, Armor Class, encumbrance, attunement and attacks come with it; other game systems are files to import, or write your own. ([Writing a game system](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/pack-rat/wiki/Writing-a-Game-System))
- **Your own items.** Custom items and templates, built from features (container, liquid, charges, writing…) and shared between campaigns in rule packages. ([Custom items](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/pack-rat/wiki/Catalog-and-Custom-Items))
- **Cards, letters and maps.** Decks to draw from, books and letters to write in, maps and handouts to zoom around. ([Sets](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/pack-rat/wiki/Sets-and-Drawing-Cards) · [Writing and pictures](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/pack-rat/wiki/Writing-and-Pictures))
- **Quick to use.** Press and hold any item for a menu of what you can do with it, search with keys like `t:armor` or `c:backpack`, and show lists as rows or tiles with exactly the details you want. ([Your inventory](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/pack-rat/wiki/Your-Inventory))
- **Yours, offline.** Several campaigns, each with its own characters; everything saved on your device, works offline, and exports to a file whenever you like. ([Settings and backups](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/pack-rat/wiki/Settings-and-Backups))

## Get started

Download the app for Windows or Android, or open it in your browser, and the [Getting Started](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/pack-rat/wiki/Getting-Started) page takes it from there. The [user guide](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/pack-rat/wiki) explains everything, with pictures; the app links to it from Settings.

## For developers

Pack Rat is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript with no build step; the party server is Python (standard library only), with a Java port in the Android app. Running it from source, building the apps, updating the item data and a map of the files: [Developing Pack Rat](https://github.com/jonathansatterthwaite-stack/pack-rat/wiki/Developing-Pack-Rat).
